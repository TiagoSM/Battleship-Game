# Battleship-Game

## Project Description
Academic project made for the OOP I subject. With the aim of practicing Object Orientation with the Java programming language.  The project consists of a classic naval battle game, where the board is 10X10 and has 1 aircraft carrier, 2 tankers, 3 destroyers and 4 submarines.


## Rules
The game is for 2 players and takes turns, the main rules are:
- On player 1's turns, player 2 must turn his back to player 1's board and vice versa.  (Since it's a game that only uses 1 computer, this is the only way...LOL)
- When starting a new game, players choose their boards respectively.
